# frozLog
A single-file php blog project from 2006. 

<h3>Background Info</h3>

Back at that time, I was sick of uploading multiple files when updating a website with my super slow dial-up connection over FTP. One day I thought <i>"why shouldn't I create a blog script that has only 1 file, so the upload process would be much easier?"</i>. This idea led me to <b>frozLog</b> - my very first published project ever. Apparently not knowing much about servers and optimization can lead to some <i>different</i> ideas.

Even though most of the PHP4 functions that I used in this are either deprecated or not preferred any more, I still have a nostalgic feeling towards this project. Also considering that this was the first beta, it was filled with numerous bugs and extremely horrible exploits. I never continued working on this, and until very recently I had no idea where the source files were. While digging through some old hard-drives, I found the files and thought I should share this as a <i>homage to my childhood</i>. Therefore I am putting this on GitHub, just in case someone might find this interesting and amusing - or funny.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul><li>PHP 4</li><li>MySQL 4</li></ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

Upload the files to your server and run <i>kur.php</i> from your browser. Enter the required information, and you should be good to go.

PS: If you manage to find a PHP4 server, or run a PHP4 server, it should probably work fine. Otherwise, you might not even log in without tweaking the code :)
